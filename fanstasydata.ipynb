    "# Predicting Fantasy Football Points for Flex Positions\n",
    "By Brett Lauer and Akhil Kammela\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Fantasy football is a game in which individuals become NFL team managers. It has become a nationwide pastime amongst families, coworkers, and friends alike. Essentially, before a season starts, everyone participating is involved in drafting a roster. They pick players from every offensive position, and select a team's defense as a whole. Every week, you select a starting lineup and watch them play. As they score touchdowns, run, pass, and catch, you accumulate points. The goal is to win every week in a one vs one by having the most points. Major sports media sites like ESPN and CBS release fantasy point predictions based on many factors to assist people in drafting. While Fantasy Football can be played casually, there are also online iterations in which people can play for real money. The main most popular sites are FanDuel and DraftKings. Both of these sites calculate each player's points differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Our goal is to do what ESPN and CBS do, but for DraftKings. Our focus is on Flex positions. These include tight end, wide receiver, and running back. The main reasons Flex is so important is that they are high scoring positions, and they all have similar in game statistics. We would like to utilize machine learning models to guess, based on players performance, how many points they will receive .We plan on looking at the 2013 through 2021 seasons to create our model, then test for accuracy and reliability using the 2022 season. In the future, someone attempting to gain an edge in DraftKings could use our model to predict points based on how a player has performed in previous seasons, and see to what degree the estimation is correct."

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "Our data came from pro-football-reference.com. It is an open source website that has massive amounts of data for any sport or player. We decided to scrape our data using CSV files for each season. The tables include receiving, rushing, and touchdown statistics, along with overall points for fantasy, Fanduel, and DraftKings."

    "## Data Cleanup\n",
    "In order to create ML models, the data needs to be organized and presentable. As explained previously, we are only focusing on flex positions. We first need to drop all players that are quarterbacks, and also drop all passing statistics since flex players rarely throw the ball. Something that ML models struggle with often in dealing with missing values. There are a couple of options to remedy this, deleting the rows, using imputation, prediction, or replacement with zeroes. While usually unfavorable, we decided to fill missing values with zero. After close examination of the CSV file, the values that were missing were always in average scores. This meant that if the overall statistic was a zero, the table counted the average of that statistic as a missing value. For example, Josh Allen, the Bills quarterback, had zero receiving yards and therefore had a missing value for average receiving yards per game. Once the main issues were dealt with, we made tables for fantasy and Draftkings alike."

    "## Kth Nearest Neighbor Regression\n",
    "The first model we decided to train was a KNN model using regression. The main reason we needed to use regression is because our prediction label, DraftKings points, is not a binary value. The range of DraftKings points is between 0-400, so regression is the obvious path to pursue. For this model, we decided to use the features previously selected by SelectKBest. KNN works by finding the distance between a query and the points in the data, it then selects the specified number of examples closest to the query. This number is denoted by K. After selection, it votes on the most frequent outcome and makes a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting K\n",
    "In order to select K, we want the model with the lowest error. We decided to use RSME (Root Mean Squared Error) as it shows the difference between predicted and actual. To analyze this, we checked neighbors 1-20 using a for loop, and plotted the results.\n"

Well generally we would need to use MAE to look at the average of the residuals, so how much the predictions of the model differ from the real world points. Now with the specific context of this project, outliers do matter to us. Being 50 points away from the predicted score cannot be considered the same as being 5 points away, hence RMSE is a useful metric for us to observe given how it treats outliers.\n",

    "Overall with the second Neural Network, we were able to build a model that can predict 2022 DraftKings point values that are accurate or at least within a close enough margin to deem the model as highly accurate as the error between the predicted and actual 2022 points is small. Looking at our process, we were successful in taking our first simple model, and choosing parameters that would minimize the size of the residuals, allowing for those closer predictions. In regards to shortcomings, it is important to note that there are a wide amount of parameters that weren't considered in the scope of this implementation and an even wider combination of parameter values, some of which could yield better predictions than our second model. In the future we would setup this project to levarge GPUs, which would allow us to compute the combinations of parameters to produce a better functioning prediction model."

    "Regarding the KNN and final Neural Network models, using sklearn's score function both models have shown to have great accuracy in predicting the 2022 DraftKings player points scores. While the models started off with lower performance, tuning hyperparameters and running exhaustive searches on parameter combinations allowed for our given acccuracies to be achieved. In the future we would like to further optimize these models, and even compare them against other regression models in an effort to product a predictor with higher accuracies, and test them on 2023 and future data."
